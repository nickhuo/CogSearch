98,217,A3CLCXBZORQ4BU,1,k2,"Bone grafts are the transplanting of bone tissue. Grafts provide a framework for the body to regrow new bone after an accident or illness. Transplanted bone can be taken from another living person or a donor who has died. Donated bone can be contaminated with diseases while bone made from collagen or ceramics will be disease free. The drawback of synthetic bone is that it is either less strong than real bone or does not provide the same nutrients and proteins that real bone provides to facilitate bone regrowth. Smoking is terrible for the chances of a successful bone graft.

Blood donation is a procedure whereby a donor agrees to have their blood withdrawn through a large bore needle and collected by medical staff to be used when people need transfusions. Whole blood donation is the simplest process whereby blood is simply taken from a person in its entirety. Blood can also be withdrawn then separated into platelets, plasma, red blood cells and white blood cells. Any combination of these can be kept for transfusion or returned into the donor. In the process of autologous donation, people have their own blood collected prior to a surgery where they know they will need a blood transfusion which lessens the risk of disease or blood type incompatibility.

Corneal transplants replace all or part of the cornea which is the focal lens of the eye. The process is called a keratoplasty. The cornea is made up of three layers, the stroma, epithelium and endothelium. When the whole cornea is replaced the procedure is a penetrating transplant while if only some of the layers are replaced it is a lamellar transplant. There are many donors of corneas so the waiting time for patients is generally much shorter than the waiting time for a kidney or a liver.

Blood Donation:
- donations are needed for millions of people per year
- there are different kinds of donations: whole blood donations, which take about 1 hour, and apheresis (taking blood and collecting certain parts), which takes about 2 hours
- most adults can donate 1 pint at a time and be OK, fluids will return in 24 hours and red blood cells will replenish in several weeks
- the practice of using only certain blood components is called blood component therapy
- blood component therapy can involve the removal of red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, or plasma
- double red cell blood donation involves taking twice the amount of red blood cells from the donor in one sitting, but returning the rest of the blood products to the donor through a second needle. These donors are also given saline to help replenish fluids.
- double red blood cell donors must fall under more specific criteria, like higher levels of hemoglobin, along with height and weight requirements
- platelets are collected and donated to patients who are susceptible to spontaneous bleeding
- donors must not take aspirin for 48 hours before donation
- donors can donate 1/4 pint at a time
- platelet donation involves apheresis, platelets are collected and the remaining products are returned to the donor
- the process takes 2 hours, and platelets can be stored for 5 days
- platelets collected from 1 donor can provide 1-3 treatment units for patients with cancer or weakened immune systems
- plasma is also collected through apheresis
- plasma is 92% water and makes up 55% of blood volume, it helps to maintain blood pressure

Synthetic bone tissue is also available now. Bone grafts can replace lost bone due to cancer or other conditions and can relieve pain. Complications can be serious, including rejection of the new tissue.
Blood donation can include all four components of blood--red blood cells, white blood cells, plasma, or platelets. Red blood cells carry iron and oxygen. White cells are responsible for fighting disease and infection. Platelets aid in clotting. Plasma also aids in clotting, immunity, and hydration (which keeps blood pressure at desirable levels). Whole blood can be donated in a quick process that lasts about ten minutes. An adult can donate about a pint of whole blood. By a process called apheresis whole blood can be separated into its constituents and the uncollected portions returned to the body. Some constituents can be frozen and stored for long periods. Some are perishable.
Corneal transplants come from a donor. More and more people are electing to become corneal donors after death. Synthetic corneas are also available now, made from acrylics or other compounds. The cornea is in three layers, the epithelium on the outside, the endothelium on the interior, and the stroma in between. Corneal transplants come with risks, including infection. The cornea can suffer from several conditions which may indicate corneal transplant. One is a malformation of the cornea which seems to be hereditary and leaves the cornea in a more cone-like shape than the usual dome. Keratitis can also affect vision and may require transplant. Fuchs dystrophy leads to the death of cells in the cornea and leads to loss of vision.

106,223,AD3LAOSY40P9U,1,k2,"     Blood donations are necessary because of surgery or disease. There are four blood types - A, B, AB, and O. The O blood type is the universal donor and the AB blood type is the universal receiver. People with A blood type are mostly from Europe. Likewise, people with B blood type are mostly from Asia. It is important to match blood types when doing blood transfusions from donor to receiver. A blood type mismatch can result in immune system reaction, which can be fatal to the receiver. Common reactions include blood in urine, low blood pressure, and even kidney failure. The O blood type is used in emergencies where their is no type to test for blood type. Blood banks serve other functions besides collections; they screen for infectious diseases such as HIV to ensure the blood supply does not become contaminated. Blood banks also, preserve blood for later use by adding anti-coagulants so that the blood does not clot before it can be used. This allows the blood to be stored for months or even years. 
     Cornea transplants are fairly common and the procedure is typically an outpatient surgery. The patient is admitted to the hospital and usually leave within a few hours. There are two types of procedures which involve replacing the entire cornea or partial. The cornea is made up of the epithelia, endothelium, and stroma. Unlike organ transplants, cornea transplants are easier because of the availability of donated corneas.

108,231,A1GG4X5KNX9V24,1,k2,"Bone Graft) Bone grafts from your body are called an autograft. Having bone or tissue from another person is called an allograft. All bone and tissue collected for donation goes through extensive testing to ensure it is disease free. Most common places for taking a graft are knees, spine, and hips. A surgeon must cut into the bone to complete a graft and this procedure can produce long term pain due for many reasons including severed nerves. Risk of infection or rejection is high and medications are given. People who have a bone graft are suffering from illness like Leukemia or various cancers. Bone/tissue grafting can be done to replace diseased parts or give aid to existing bone and tissue. Most donated bone and tissue come from the deceased who have had their bodies donated for medical purposes. All donors are extensively tested for any existing diseases.

Blood Donation) Blood donation is done to provide extra blood to those who have suffered an accident or illness. All donors are tested for diseases prior to donating blood. Anyone who has had surgery, been pregnant, or gotten a tattoo cannot donate for at least one year. The chances of contracting HIV through blood donation are now lower than the chances of getting hit by lightening. Newborn babies suffering from severe Jaundice (an excess of Bilirubin in their system) may need a blood transfusion to flush out their systems because their organs cannot adequately process the extra bilirubin. This procedure is done if light therapy has not been successful. There are many blood types both positive and negative but blood type O is most wanted for donation because it can normally be given to a person of any blood type without reaction. When some people donate they are hooked up to special machines that separate the white blood cells or platelets from their blood for donation. 

Corneal Transplants) The eye has 3 layers called the epthilium, stroma, and endothilium. When someone has a diseased cornea they get a transplant from a donor. Usually the donor is dead and has gone through extensive testing for disease. Having a corneal transplant is an outpatient procedure. The diseased layers are cut with an instrument like a cookie cutter and new layers are sewn on using nylon thread. A microscope is used for the surgery. Because the cornea as no blood vessels it takes a very long time for it to heal. It can take up to a full year before a person can have the full benefits of the surgery. Sometimes the nylon threads are never removed. This surgery is called kerotplasty.

Corneal transplants are needed when a patients cornea has become diseased or damaged. Fortunately, there is a good supply of corneas from deceased patients, making a long wait unnecessary. The cornea as an organ is important for vision and focus so if one of its three layers (the epithelium, stroma or endothelium) become damaged, either a full (penetrating) corneal transplant or partial (lamallar) corneal transplant might be needed. Interestingly, Corneas get their nourishment from tears as there is no blood cell ""connectivity"" in the cornea.

A bone graft is the transplant of bone tissue. Surgeons use bone grafts to repair and rebuild diseased bones, tendons, and cartilage in the hips, knees and spine. Bone grafts can be used to enhance the density and quality of existing bones or to reduce suffering from cancer or tumors. If the transplated bone comes from someone else, it is called an allograft. Most allografts come from the bones of people who have died. Donated bones are frozen. If the transplanted bone originates from another part of the patient’s own body, it is called an autograft. In some cases they use a man-made substitute. Drawbacks from the procedure include pain if nerves are cut, or rejection of the implants. Bone grafts enable the body to build new bones by providing a framework to support the growth of new bone cells. An allograft usually comes from dead people with excellent medical histories who have chosen to be organ donors. Freezing the bones reduces the risk of transmitting infection and disease. Autografts reduce the risk of rejection because they come from the patients own body.

Blood donation is a procedure where a person agrees to have their blood drawn so that it can be used for transfusions or to make blood products. Millions of people need blood transfusions each year because of surgery or disease. The most common blood donation is to take blood from the vein. A large needle is used to minimize the forces that can damage the blood cells as they flow through the needle. The blood is stored in a flexible plastic bag. Another blood donation type is aphresis in which the whole blood goes through a special machine to separate it into parts such as red blood cells, plasma, platelets, and white blood cells. Healthy people can donate a pint of blood without any problems. The body replaces the lost fluids within 24 hours of a donation. The lost red blood cells get replenished within several weeks. Blood banks preserve blood by adding chemicals that keep the blood from clotting until it is needed. The process where blood turns from a liquid to a gel is called coagulation or clotting. Blood banks useananticoagulant, such as Heparin and refrigerate the blood to keep it liquid. It is possible to store blood for years depending on the component. Blood banks also test the blood for infection agents. Besides getting HIV, another risk is getting CJD from a transfusion. CJD is the human version of mad cow disease and is very rare, but fatal brain disorder. Some blood banks remove white blood cells from the blood. This is called leukocyte reduction. Some people are allergic to white blood cells in donated blood. Every person has one of the following blood types: A, B, AB, or O. This is determined by whether the blood contains the A- or B- antigen, both, or neither. About 40% of americans have type O blood

 A bone graft is a transplant of bone tissue. Bone graphs are used to rebuild damaged and diseased bones. Some bone grafts come from people who have died young or unexpectedly, persons with any history of cancer are not suitable to donate bone graft. An alternative to a bone graft is a man made bone substitute. 

A cornea transplant is where the cornea is replaced with the cornea from a donor. There is often not a long wait for people to get a cornea transplant. People who need cornea transplants often have diseases or conditions of the eye.

186,402,1001,1,k2,"Bone grafts may be necessary for people who have fractured a bone or for people with diseases that cause bone loss. 
Bone grafts are common in the hip, spine, and knee regions. 
The bone tissue may come either from the patient themselves or from a donor who has died. 
Bone grafts may result in chronic pain if the doctor accidentally damages nerves during surgery. 
Bone samples must be screened and tested throughly to ensure that they are safe for the recipient (e.g. that they are not cancerous bones). 
Sometimes man-made bones are used in bone grafts. 


Blood donation is another important way that donors can make a difference because many people need blood transfusions everyday. 
Blood is either collected from donors in its whole form, or it is separated into its four different parts: red blood cells, white blood cells, plasma, and platelets. 
Plasma and platelets help with blood clotting in the body. 
Red blood cells make hemoglobin. 
The red and white bloods cells work to defend the body again infection. 
AB Plasma is the plasma type that can be accepted by anybody (i.e. it is the universal type). 
People can safely donate plasma once a month.
It is not advisable to take Aspirin for at least 48 hours before donating blood, as Aspirin is a blood thinner.
Sometimes people have blood taken to be used by themselves at a later stage (e.g. after surgery). 
It is safe to donate approximately 1 pint of blood at a time. 


The cornea is a cone-shaped part of the eye. 
It consists of three layers. 
Sometimes a corneal transplant replaces the whole cornea, and sometimes not all of the layers need to be replaced. 
A person might need a corneal transplant after having cataract surgery, or if they have some disorder, such as Fuchs disorder. 
The cornea is a delicate structure and rejection occurs in 1 of 5 cases. 
Scientists from Switzerland and Canada have developed a synthetic cornea made of collagen. 
Generally people who are waiting for a cornea are able to get one quickly compared to a liver or heart transplant. This is because more people seem willing to donate their corneas.

Blood Donation

Blood donation may consist of complete blood donation, or just red cell donation.

Large needle is used when red blood cells are taken.  Other three parts of blood (white cells, plasma, platelets) are returned to body without damage.  Saline is also added.  Saline may cause patient may be light-headed after procedure.

Red cell collection takes 2 hours, only 10 minutes of which are actual collection.

Liquid is returned to blood system in 24 hours; red cell replacement takes longer. 



Corneal Transplants

The cornea is made of 3 layers, and it is dome-shaped.  It has no blood vessels, but gets its nourishment from tears.

It may be replaced completely, or just one or two of the layers may be replaced.

Corneal transplants are more common than liver or kidney transplants, because more people donate corneas at death.

Corneas are replaced to improve focus or to improve the way they look.

191,407,1004,1,k2,"Bone grafts are very useful, and can be used for repairing injured bone or just for reinforcing weak bones. Usually an incision is made in the bone, near the injured site, and new bone tissue is put in, to form a framework for new bone growth. Athletes who have injured knees or people who have back pain can either have bone grafts in the knee of spine. Compared to other types of surgery, this surgery causes minimal trauma for the patient, but there is still risk of the patient rejecting the inserted bone tissue. 

Bone grafts are separated into three types, according to where the transplanted bone comes from. When a patient transplants a part of his own bone into a new site, it is called an autograph. The bone can come from many places, such as the hip, but never the knee or the spine. If the transplanted bone comes from another donor, usually a deceased one, it is called an allograph. Nowadays, there is also the choice to use synthetic bone.

Blood donation starts with the process of collecting blood, and there are two different ways. The first method is taking whole blood directly from the vein. The skin over the vein from which we want to collect blood is thoroughly sanitized, and a large needle is usually chosen to minimize the shearing damage that the red blood cells might suffer from when passing through the needle. The second method is called apheresis, where blood is passed through a machine before collection. These machines can separate blood, and allow us to collect only what we need. 

When donating blood, we match up the donor and the recipient’s blood type to reduce the chance of rejection. There is type O, type A, type B, and type AB. They either have antigen A, antigen B, both, or neither. 40% of the people in America are type O, type B is more common in Asia, and type A is more common in Europe. People who are type O are called universal donors while type AB people are called universal recipients. There is also a difference between Rh-positive and Rh-negative. If someone is Rh-positive, they can receive both Rh-positive and Rh-negative blood. When there is an emergency, however, and there isn’t enough time to test a patient’s blood type, the patient is given type O blood. 

Blood banks do many things, including storing blood, testing blood, and processing it. Blood congeals, or “coagulates”, very soon if it isn’t treated. In order to store blood for long periods of time, blood banks inject anticoagulants into the collected blood. Blood banks can also test blood for HIVs, and modern technology has become so reliable that there is less chance of getting an HIV from donated blood that getting stung by a wasp. Some people are allergic to the white blood cells in donated blood, and blood banks can process the donated blood beforehand to separate the white blood cells. 

The cornea is what allows our eyes to focus and see. There are two types of corneal transplants, the first replaces only the outer layer of the cornea, and the second replaces the outer, middle, and inner layer of the cornea. Many people have elected to donate their cornea upon passing away, so the wait for corneas is not as long as the wait for livers or kidneys. The interesting thing is that in all layers of the cornea, there are no veins, so the cornea receives its nutrition from the oxygen contained in tears.

195,411,1007,1,k2,"Bone grafts are usually done in the spine, hips, and knees. They can involve grafting onto bone, tendons, or cartilage. A lot of the time, people need bone grafts when they have cancers or tumors. Bone grafts involves the surgeon making a deep incision in the bone so that the graft can be inserted into the patient. The bone graft provides a structure on which the patient’s own cells can grow and multiply. However, there is the risk of the patient’s body rejecting the graft. The graft site may also be in pain after the procedure if the doctor accidently cuts into a nerve. Bone grafts can be taken from the patient’s own body (called autograft), from a donor (called an allograft), or be a man-made substance. Bone grafts usually come from deceased donors that were in good health while they were alive. The health of the patient is strictly screened for and the donated bone grafts are kept frozen at donation banks.
	The cornea is the clear, dome-shaped part of the eye. There are three layers to the cornea – the epithelium, stroma, and endothelium. A cornea transplant can replace all three layers or just one or two of the layers. The transplant is done by making an incision in the side of the eye, removing the damaged tissue, inserting the transplant tissue, and then either sewing the incision closed or gluing it closed. Cornea transplant donors are deceased individuals that passed strict health and quality standards. Diseases that may require corneal transplants are cataracts, herpes, and a disease in which the cornea starts to take on a cone-like bulge. When a patient has cataracts, the cataract is first broken up by very small waves of energy and then these pieces can be suctioned out. Although there are two types of herpes, it is mostly herpes I that affects the cornea, although herpes II can migrate and affect the cornea as well. Corneal transplants can involve inserting something under the patient’s iris that becomes a permanent part of the eye. This insertion allows light to focus on the retina more properly so that vision is restored.
	Blood donation can be done as a whole blood donation (where all components of the blood are given) or as a donation of just one component of blood. The four components of whole blood are red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and plasma. The donation time depends on the type of donation and what is being harvested, but can range from 1 hour to 2 hours. Donating whole blood takes about 1 hour, with the actual collection time being about 10 minutes. Donating just a component of the blood (called aphaeresis) can take up to 2 hours. The red blood cells are important because they contain hemoglobin, which is a protein that transports oxygen throughout the body. Platelets help the blood to clot at wound sites. Plasma is the fluid part of blood and comprises about 55% of the blood volume. Plasma also helps with clotting. Double red blood cell donation can also be done and this requires special criteria from the donor – they must have high hemoglobin levels. In this procedure, the red blood cells are separated from the rest of the blood and collected, while the rest of the blood is transfused back into the donor with some saline. This can leave the donor feeling more hydrated than they previously were.

Overall
-	surgery that replaces bone tissue, generally in hip, knee, or spine
-	reasons inc. back pain, cancer (where surgeries have permanently damaged bone), degraded bone, athletes, etc.
-	rigorous medical history screening for donors
-	types: autograft, allograft, and artificial bone tissue graft (benefits of latter include lack of a waiting list and lower risk of infection and rejection )
Autograft
-	from own body
-	generally from hip (or other nonessential bones, not knees)
-	benefits: live bone, lower risk of rejection/transplant complications, don’t have to wait for donor
-	risks: second surgical incision (therefore increased pain, possibility of infection)
Allograft
-	from other body (generally posthumous donations)
-	screened (4 HIV cases from fresh frozen, 0 disease transmissions from freeze dried – now most common method), cancer history not allowed to donate, generally from young, disease-free adults (posthumous)
-	benefits: only 1 surgery on patient (therefore lower risk of infection, lower pain, etc.)
-	risks: longer wait times (few donors), higher risk of rejection, possibility of infection from donated bone tissue (however, low)

BLOOD DONATION
Screening
-	HIV risk (now very low due to good screening) and Creuks-Jacobs (human mad cow) risk (if in contact with affected patient, may not donate) very low
-	Minimum age (16 or 17 depending on state) and weight limits (upper limit often determined by donation chair/bed, if at all) because development and body weight affects possibility of side effects (fainting, exhaustion, anemia, etc.))
-	Many screening questions, medical history screening
-	Cannot donate during pregnancy/6 weeks after, for 1 year following a transfusion, while healing from surgery, and other conditions without a doctors’ express permission
Uses
-	Transfusions (blood can last weeks to up to a year, depending on method)
-	Remove certain cells (i.e. in cancer patients, such as those with leukemia)
Process
-	Large needle used to prevent damage to blood cells
-	Blood goes through clean plastic tubing into flexible bag (where it is collected and sealed)
-	Blood is sent to a large screening center to ensure it is safe and disease-free
-	Fluid levels return to normal within a few days, different cell levels within a few weeks
Blood Type
-	A, B, AB, O (Universal)
-	Locations often correlates with type (40% US is type O, Europe largely type A, Asia/South Asia largely type B and AB)
-	Also Rh+ and Rh- (+ can accept both)
-	Accepting the wrong blood type can lead to nausea, skin yellowing, pain, etc.. and possibly even death
Removing certain types of cells
-	Can only remove certain types of cells, and return majority of fluid/other cell types to donor (therefore can take more of any one cell type)
-	Used to treat certain diseases such as leukemia
-	Usually 1 needle per arm, blood flows through machine to be separated then returned. If veins are too small, needles can be put on 1 or both sides of the neck

-One positive aspect of allografts is that the patients dont need to have 2 surgeries. This is also positive because it would cost them less money as well
-Although an autograft requires 2 surgeries, it is sometimes recommended because there is less of a chance that the body will reject the bone graft, since it comes from the patients own body
-autografts often do a better job of growing fresh bone 
-to perform the surgery, doctors usually take a section of bone from nonessential bones, such as the hip. 
-patients can sometimes feel pain from a bone graft surgery, but since medicine has become more advanced, this is less likely
-many people are donating their corneas after they die, so those who need corneas won’t have as long of a wait as those who need kidneys or other organs

-not all surgeries penetrate all 3 layers but, they can.
-one corneal disease is keratoconus. This is when the cornea is coned shape. The cause of this disease is still unknown, but it is thought to be genetic because if your parents had this disease, there is a 50% chance that you will get it. The coned shape cornea will caused blurred/damaged vision, which is why you would need a transplant if you had this disease

Cornea transplants could be transplant of total eye or one of three layers.  Cornea transplants are more common and require less waiting time because corneas are harvested from dead people.  Corneas do not gain nutrition from blood supply but rather from oxygen in tears.  Transplants are done for damaged or diseased eyes.

Blood transfusions are safer now because of testing done to check medical history from donors and way in which blood is withdrawn.

Donated material is checked for diseases and other things that make it not suitable; it is frozen and kept tip needed at a bone tissue bank.  When needed a deep cut is made in the bone and the graft material inserted; the graft material provides a structure for new growth of bone.  A doctor can inadvertently cut a nerve which can result in chronic pain.  Additionally there is a small possibility that the graft will be rejected by the body.

Blood donation: Humans have 4 blood types: a, b, ab or o.  O is a universal donor material that can be used by anyone; AB is a universal receiver - it can have transfusions of any of the blood types.  Blood donations are normally whole blood, but there are specialized donations of just red blood cells, platelets or plasma - one is hooked to a machine and this process extracts the desired ingredient and the remained is injected back into the donor.  Some people are allergic to white blood cells in a transfusion and that is a reason they are sometimes removed.  After the blood is donated it is normally stored in a flexible plastic bag; it has anti-clotting agents added and is refrigerated; donated blood can be kept up to a few years.  Blood donors are tested for diseases (HIV for example) and disqualified from donating.  A blood donor regenerates the fluids removed in a day and the blood cells in about a month.  People under 110 pounds are disqualified, as are pregnant women up until 6 weeks after the birth of the child.  There is no maximum weight limit for a donor except if the weight is too great for the chair they will be using.  A blood donation is normally about a pint.  Dizzyness is a potential after effect of donating blood, more common in people with low weight.

Corneal Transplants:  the cornea consists of three layers:  ehelium outer layer; stoma middle layer, and exhelium inner layer.
The outer layer protects the cornea from physical damage, it extracts oxygen from tears to nourish the cornea, and one other thing.  The middle layer is about 90% of the thickness of the cornea and is made up of about 100 layers.  Corneal transplants can replace the entire cornea or just some layers.  If the entire cornea is replaced, the new cornea is held in place with very thin nylon suchers. If just the top layer is replaced it is also held in place with thin nylon suchers.  If just the bottom layer is replaced, a bubble of air is inserted under it and that holds it in place until it heals.  Transplants take a long time to heal - up to a year, and the suckers are often left in that long.  It may often take up to a year for full vision acuity to return.  Many people allow their corneas to be harvested when they die, so there is typically not a long wait for a transplant.",bone knees hips spines donor material material diseases bone tissue bank bone graft material graft material growth bone nerve result pain graft body blood donation blood donor material transfusions blood blood donations blood donations blood cells platelets plasma machine process donor blood cells transfusion blood plastic agents blood blood donors diseases blood donor fluids blood cells pounds birth weight limit donor weight blood donation pint blood weight transplants cornea layers layer layer layer layer cornea damage oxygen tears cornea layer thickness cornea layers transplants cornea layers cornea cornea nylon layer nylon layer bubble air transplants vision acuity return corneas transplant,100,5.00

204,422,2008,1,k2,"Corneas have 3 layers, the epithelial, the stroma, and the endothelial. Only the epithelial layer has the ability to regenerate. The epithelial layer is the thinnest layer. The stroma is about 90% of the cornea in thickness. The purpose of the epithelial layer is to prevent objects from entering the eye and to help focus light. It is sensitive and that helps prevent injury. It also absorbs nutrients from the tears since the cornea does not have blood vessels. The stroma has a large number of layers. If one layer is damaged or diseased, a medical procedure can replace just the damaged layer. Some stroma cells can do some repair. The endothelial layer can stretch to cover damaged or diseased cells, but this reduces the transparency of the cornea. Corneas can be replaced using donated corneas. These come from deceased persons. More corneas are donated than other organs so people needing cornea transplants do not need to wait long. The transplant is done with a tiny instrument that looks like a tiny cookie cutter. After the epithelial layer is operated on, it is joined with nylon sutures. They can be left for weeks or even permanently. Just a few of The stroma layers can be operated on at one time if needed. When the endothelial layer is operated on, the surgeon may use a needle to force a small bubble of air between the stroma and endothelial layer to force the endothelial layer into place. It is not sutured and this allows it to heal faster.

Blood donations are used to get needed red blood cells, plasma, and another item. The red blood cells can be damaged while withdrawn so a large needle is used to prevent that. The blood is stored in flexible plastic bags. A procedure can draw blood and separate it into blood cells, plasma or other and retain only the needed part. A donor can donate a pint of blood and will regenerate it in 24 hour. 

Bone grafts can be 12 inches long. Bone is regenerated from live cells. One article also described artificial bone that can help a destroyed bone to regenerate. The bone graft can be from the patients own bone and is usually taken from the pubic area. Bone marrow can be used to help regenerate bone. If a surgical operation is needed, the patient will take longer to heal. If bone marrow is used, the surgeon can extract the marrow with a needle and insert it with a needle. This will result in shorter healing time. Bone has two layers.

Doctors may cut into the bone area and the after effects may be painful to varying degrees.  The source of material from others is usually a deceased person who has agreed to be a donor.

Eye part transplants are done to correct various deficiencies that impact vision.  Most conditions are due to hereditary conditions but some come from infections such as Type 1 herpes. Cornea transplants can involve up to three layers. For the inner layer, the doctor will insert a device that sonically destroys the inner layer for easy removal. Replacement  can be from a donor or synthetic. 

Blood transfusions can involve whole blood or components such a red, white platelet or plasma . The component donation takes longer and includes returning the uncollected portion back to the donor. This return portion is supplemented with saline solution to maintain the donors blood pressure.  If donating platelets the patient is asked to stop taking aspirin.

The shelf life of these donated components varies from days to years.  The advantage of self donation is avoidance of tissue rejection.  In the case of materials received from others, special attention is paid to match patient to donor to minimize rejection.

A  standard  blood draw is taken from a prominent vein usually from the inside of the elbow and is done with a large needle to keep the red blood cells from being damaged  as they would be with a small needle. If only red blood cells are extracted they usually go into a small tube for tests.  If other parts of the blood are needed such as separate red blood cells, plasma, or platelets a machine called an apheresis is used to separate the three components and the blood that is left is stored in a sterile plastic bag and put back into the donor.  Giving blood is  very common and the fluid is usually replaced within 24 hours.  Red blood cells are replaced in 1-2 weeks.

A storage facility under extremely low temperature stores bones taken (usually for corpses) for use when needed for use on a live person..  a depression as one example is put into a damaged bone  cleaned and sterilized and the donor graft shaped and fit into the place it is needed.    A graft from a storage unit is called an allgraft and one from the same person is called a self graft.  Infection is watched for carefully and the bones will slowly grow together giving the individual use of the damaged part.

Blood Donation: There are a variety of methods in collecting blood. Regular donation, double red blood donation, plasma donation, and platelet donation. All donations are stored similarly but some may last longer than others. Platelet donations can last about 5 days frozen. Plasma donations, frozen, can last up to 10 years. Double blood donations can last a few days. For donations that require separation, aphaeresis is used. Regular blood donation periods last roughly 20-30 minutes. A double blood donation lasts longer, but there are more stringent qualifications for donors: for example, they must have a higher hemoglobin count and meet certain height and weight standards. Additionally, double blood donors have to wait much longer, around 4 months, to donate again. Regular blood donors experience fluid restoration within 24 hours and red blood cell restoration a few weeks after donation (roughly 3 weeks). Plasma donations can take up to two hours, but donors can donate again after just two weeks. Platelet donation takes roughly 75 minutes. Because platelet donations are in high demand for those with cancer and autoimmune diseases, doctors recommend people donate with that in mind – that they need to be used quickly in order to not be wasted. Patients in need of certain surgeries who want to utilize their own donations may do so, but they have to donate in a certain timeframe (4 days before surgery is not acceptable). Plasma in particular is a liquid that makes up 55% of blood itself. Platelets are useful because they help with clotting and healing. All donations must go through testing to insurance certain diseases are not present. AB blood types can donate to everyone regardless of recipient blood type. 

Bone Graft: Bone grafts are crucial for healing fractured or recessed bones, as well as tendons. Areas most affected are hips, knees, ankles, elbows, and wrists. A bone graft can help to lay down a structure for new bone to grow as well as connect disconnected bone pieces. Most often people receive bone grafts from deceased individuals, who gave prior consent legally. When an individual receives a bone graft from another person, it is called an allograft. When a person receives a bone graft from themselves, it is called an autograft. There are complications, however, such as the graft being rejected or chronic pain localized to the graft site due to nerve damage. Bone graft material is frozen until it needs to be used. 

Corneal Transplants: Keratoplasty (also known as corneal transplant) is used when the cornea is too diseased or no longer operating optimally. Diseases such as hepatitis keratitis (type 1, type 2) affect the cornea. Type 1 hepatitis keratitis often occurs in children but can occur in adults, and involves a topical ointment as treatment or an oral medicine. In this case a corneal transplant is not needed. Moderate cases usually involve a build-up of dead corneal cells and discharge, sometimes only when asleep; in extreme cases, blisters can occur, and there is generally more pain and discomfort. 

When just part of a cornea requires surgery, a lamellar corneal transplant is performed. Often donations come from deceased individuals who gave prior consent (and donations are on the rise, so many dont have to worry about waiting for a donation). In cataract surgeries, some operations entail creating a slit in the cornea.  Cataracts are thin membrane lenses located over the cornea. The epithelium is the outermost part, the endothelium is the innermost part, the stroma is responsible for hydration. 

There is another corneal disease in which the cornea takes on a cone-like shape, which causes blurry vision, problems with depth perception, and pain. It tends to develop over 10-20 years,  and severity varies. It is hereditary; a person with at least one parent to have it is 50% likely to also develop the condition although it can occur without a genetic predisposition. Technologies like site(?) lamps and computer corneal mapping help to diagnose it, although subtle cases require more testing. 

Researchers in Sweden, among other nations, have recently discovered a process by which to create synthetic corneas. The technology proves useful because there is a lower likelihood of transmitting diseases and rejection.

211,429,2011,1,k2,"Blood donation can be done about every 8 weeks.  Cells are replaced in 8 weeks and fluid is replaced in a few days.  The needle used is large so that cells are not damaged in the process.  The skin is cleaned and stretched before the needle is inserted.  The process of apheresis allows the component parts of the blood to be separated and used for different purposes.  The blood is collected in a plastic bag and stored for later use.  

Bone grafts are done to replace tissue that has been damaged or diseased.  Bone can be lost due to diabetes or to smoking.  Nicotine acts like a poison to bone tissue.  Bone can be used from the patients own pelvis, as an allograft.  That is using ones own bone rather than donated bone.  When donated bone is used, it is harvested and checked for disease and stored, sometimes as powdered bone.  Bone can be used to help secure an artificial joint such as a knee or hip.  The graft grows around the new joint.  It is also used in spinal surgeries where diseased tissue is removed, as with spinal fractures or injuries that are then replaced or stabilized. Bone grafts can be very large pieces or can be small or powdered material. After a graft from a donor, the patient may need to have medication such as antibiotics or chemotherapy to help reduce the chance of rejecting the tissue.  In some cases, bone marrow cells can be used instead of bone cells.  These will grow and create new bone tissue.

Corneal transplants are among the most common transplant surgeries.  Many people are much more willing to say that their corneas can be harvested than, for example their livers or other organs.  So cornea transplant patients generally dont have to wait so long for their surgery.   The cornea is in three layers, the epithelium, endothelium and the stroma.  The cornea has no blood supply, so it gets its oxygen from tears in the eye.  Surgery an be done on the entire organ, or on each individual layer, depending on which layer is diseased or damaged.  On the epithelium, a scratch can often heal without treatment.  The endothelium or inner layer, functions as a pump to move fluid through the stroma.  If fluid accumulates in the stroma, it can become hazy, and less transparent.  The outer layer acts to focus light, the stroma conducts that light, so it must stay transparent.  When the  surgeon works on only one or two layers, that is a keratoplasty.  He or she can even remove just part of one layer.  The outer layer is composed of six layers of cells.  The middle layer is composed of about 20 layers of cells.  Surgery on the outer and middle layer is secured with nylon sutures that remain in place for several weeks.  The length of time is because of the lack of blood supply.  The inner layer will not have sutures, but is secured by the doctor injecting a bubble of air to apply pressure to that tissue.  This allows the tissue to heal around the air bubble.  After surgery, vision continues to slowly improve over time as the tissue heals.

212,430,1016,1,k2,"Bone Grafts
Bone grafts are used in patients who have had fractured bones or bone loss due to illness – such as cancer. The bone graft allows for a foundation for healthy repair and growth of bone tissue. There are three types of bone grafts discussed in this article: allografts, autografts, and man-made tools. Allografts are provided from external donors, usually after the donor has died. The donor consents prior to death to providing bone tissue for those who need it once dead. Autografts are provided from the patients own body, from a location of health tissue. Finally, in some cases, a doctor may use a man-made tool as a bone graft. In each case, the grafts are frozen and stored to prevent infection and transmission of disease. The grafts are checked for compatibility with a patient. The two main problems with bone grafts which are discussed are rejection of transplant and chronic pain at the site of surgery. The latter can occur during surgery. When the surgeon makes an incision at the site of transplant, if nerves are inadvertently cut, it can lead to chronic pain.

Cornea Transplants
The cornea is the surface of the eye, and it protects the eye. The cornea does not have blood supply, so it uses tears. This also means that the cornea takes a long time to heal. There are three layers of the cornea: epithelium (the outermost layer), stroma (middle layer), and endothelium (innermost layer). The stroma is primarily made up of water and collagen fibers. Damage to these collagen fibers is serious and will require plenty of repair. The epithelium has three main functions. Firstly, it protects the eye from debris and damage. Secondly, it collects nutrients from tears and distributes these nutrients to the rest of the cornea. Finally, the epithelium is responsible for focusing in vision. The epithelium is somewhat regenerative – if there is a minor scratch, the epithelium is capable of healing. However, if surgery is required, a lamellar kyratoplasty is used, and there is no suture required. A lamellar surgery is used if there is damage to one or two of the three layers. If there is damage to all three layers, a penetrating kyratoplasty is used. With the penetrating surgery, a nylon suture is used. In a lamellar procedure, if there is damage to two layers, a suture is also used. The surgery itself is performed using a tool which looks like a cookie cutter. A cornea transplant is considered an outpatient surgery. This means that the patient arrives at the hospital, goes through surgery, stays in the hospital for a few hours after the surgery, and leaves the hospital. There is usually no overnight stay involved. Healing from a cornea transplant can take a couple of weeks, but sometimes, the process may take much longer. Some people require a year or more to regain full focusing capability with the eye. More donors today are making their corneas available post-mortem, which means that patients who require transplants do not have to wait as long as they once might have. The process is also less complicated as it used to be because it is possible to perform surgery and remove only the diseased areas. It is possible to leave the healthy areas intact while performing surgery on the diseased layers.

213,431,2012,1,k2,"Bone grafts are divided into two types, allografts and autografts. An allograft comes from another person; an autograft from the patient him- or herself. The advantages to an allograft are that there is no need for a second incision to get the patients own bone. Also, the bone is carefully examined for compatibility and freedom from disease. The advantages to an autograft are that the bone is the patients own and is less likely to cause rejection. IF an autograft is used, the patient then has two surgical sites to heal, which may delay healing.

Blood transfusion is the process of removing blood from one person to be used by that same person (as in after surgery) or another compatible person. Blood has 4 types: A, B, AB, and O. These blood types differ in the amount of A and B antigens which are present. Type O blood is termed the “Universal Donor” as this blood type may be given to any of the 4 blood types. The AB blood type is known as the “Universal Recipient” as they can receive blood from any of the four types. A large needle is used to draw the blood for a transfer to avoid damaging the blood cells.

A cornea transplant is the act of replacing all or several layers of the transparent cornea on the front of the eye. This layer has no blood cells and is nourished through oxygen from tears. The cornea is the part of the eye primarily responsible for focusing. When it becomes damaged, a replacement can restore functionality. The cornea has three layers (though I dont remember the names of the outer and inner, the middle is the stoma).

214,432,2013,1,k2,"Bone grafts are used to repair injuries to the spine, hips or knees due to accidents or from tumors or  cancers. There are two types of bone grafts, allografts and autografts. There are also artificial substances that can be grafted.  Allografts are from a donor, usually deceased. They are screened to be sure they are healthy and the donations are frozen.  Autografts are from oneself. They can repair bones and tendons. The downside of a bone graft, the site of the graft can be damaged and can cause chronic pain.  The upside of a graft is the body will grow new cells and tissue to surround the graft, if successful. 

Blood donation is a life saving measure. It is drawn from your arm using a needle.There are four components to blood. Red blood cells, white blood cells, plasma and platelets. It takes about thirty minutes to donate one pint of blood, that is all you can donate at a time. The body can recover within 24 hours. Another process is allpheris, where only parts of the blood are taken. You can donate your own blood prior to surgery.  In elderly patients this is usually not done. Due to weakened conditions.  You can have your blood drawn and the part they need is taken and replace with saline and returned to your body. The blood supply is  very safe now due to all the screenings and precautions they take


Corneal Transplants are the most common transplants, the cornea is the dome shaped part of the eye.  It has no blood supply, it receives oxygen from tears. The cornea has three layers.  Corneas are donated by healthy deceased people. This is the most common donation.

215,433,1017,1,k2,"Bone graft are often done to strengthen a weakened bone, to replace bone damaged by an injury or by chemotherapy or radiation therapy, or to give existing bone marrow a “boost” (this last is not as preferred as straightforward marrow donations if marrow can be collected and transplanted through a needle, but it is a common effect if the marrow and outer layer of bone are both collected). If the bone is taken from the person it will be used in, it is considered an autograft, but when collected from another person (who may or may not be dead, as bone can be harvested from deceased donors), it is an allograft. The graft may consist of ceramic, which can offer strength but does not have the living cells or porosity of living bone; “spongy” bone, which has the living cells but not always the strength of the outer layer of bone it replaces; or a composite of both.

A note on the injury done by chemotherapy or radiation therapy: bone is built up by osteoblasts and destroyed by osteoclasts (the destruction is necessary for the growth of new bone, so the presence of osteoclasts is more beneficial than at first glance.) However, radiation therapy and chemotherapy can often destroy these cells, requiring a transplant from living bone to get the process kick-started again in the injured section of bone.

Patients’ recovery from a bone graft can vary widely based on things like age, general health, and the extent of the transplant itself. Children can recover very quickly, while adults might need three months or more before they have recovered enough to resume their normal lives. Patients also need to avoid radiation therapy and chemotherapy for at least six months after their graft. Nicotine and how often a transplant patient smokes can affect how well their graft “takes.” One recent study shows that non-smokers outperformed regular smokers and those who had reduced how often they smoked when the stability and strength of their bone graft was assessed. However, even a reduction in how often they smoked positively affected how well the bone graft held up after six months.

Sometimes a graft is performed not because of a need for marrow or bone reconstruction, but to stabilize an otherwise weak joint and relieve pain. One such particular graft is a spinal fusion. The patient in question usually has spinal problems that end up compressing certain nerves, causing constant pain. The graft can be taken from a place where it is unlikely to cause injury, often from the ischium or iliac crest of the pelvis, and fused into the patients spine to strengthen and stabilize the vertebrae and take the pressure off the nerves.

Blood donation can benefit far more people than might first be imagined. One unit of whole blood is roughly a pint, which a healthy adult can donate in ten minutes without suffering any major health issues. However, that whole unit of blood can be split into red blood cells, which carry oxygen; white blood cells, the bodys “defenders” and part of the human immune system; plasma, the liquid portion that accounts for 55% of blood by volume; and platelets, which assist in clotting wounds. All of these can benefit those who they are donated to, and the whole process takes maybe two hours (including the short time the donor spends donating it.)

Due to the varying needs of those who receive donated blood and the fact that sometimes getting enough of the needed portion from whole blood is difficult, different methods of extracting these portions of blood have been developed. Red blood cells can be extracted by taking blood from a donor, running it through a machine that separates red blood cells from the rest of the blood, and returning the remaining portion to the donor. This can be safely done once a month, although the donor may be cautioned against exercising for a few days.

Plasmaphoresis is the process by which plasma is extracted for use. Similar to extracting red blood cells, plasma is obtained by drawing whole blood, running it through a machine that separates the plasma from the remaining portion of blood, and returning the unwanted cells to the donor. The whole process takes seventy-five minutes, more or less. The requirements for plasma donation are stricter than for ordinary blood donation, and usually require not only higher levels of hemoglobin, but also that the donor meet certain height and weight requirements. The donor is usually rehydrated with an IV during this time, and often needs a few days before they return to rigorous exercise. Plasma can help with blood pressure, immune system, and blood volume problems, so its donation is just as vital as the other cells in blood, and it can be stored in its frozen state for months to years before use.

Platelets help in clotting blood, but they are maddeningly difficult to extract from whole blood – one treatment unit of platelets for a patient might require four to six pints of whole blood. A simpler method involves blood being drawn from a donor, the platelets extracted, and the blood returned to the donor without the needle being withdrawn. After several of these cycles, the donor is released and can resume daily activities. However, platelets have a very short shelf life before they are useless at only a few days, and if the donor took any blood thinners such as aspirin within three days of the donation, it could be all for nothing.

Auto-donation is when someones blood is extracted and put back into their system. This could be during the surgery, when blood that might be pooling in a surgical site is pumped back into the patients veins, or this could be preemptive, such as a patient donating several units of blood prior to a surgery where they may be needed. This is not recommended for elderly patients, who are not as likely to quickly recover from repeated donations as younger patients, and patients cannot donate blood three days before a surgery.

Corneas are the clear, dome-shaped outer portion of the eye. They are what allows the eye to focus and allows their owner to see. They consist of three layers: the exothelium, the outermost layer; the stroma, the middle portion; and the endothelium, the innermost layer of the cornea. All of this is nourished by tears, not by blood vessels, which helps simplify the donation process. The donation process is further simplified by the fact that many more people opt to donate their corneas upon death, meaning people with damaged corneas or vision issues caused by their corneas will not have to wait long for a transplant.

216,434,2014,1,k2,"Corneal transplant might be needed due to herpes kerisitis a viral infection – there are two types of herpes type 1 and type two – type two is sexually transmitted the first is more common to infect the eyes most are exposed to this in childhood – then it lies dormant and can be reactivated by stress, menstration and other things.  Type one results in canker sores or sores by your mouth.  And can be transmitted to your eyes due to hand contact on your face to your eyes. 

The corneal transplant is for tissues in the cornea – there are three layers of the cornea – one is the stroma – cornea does not have blood vessels – it gets its oxygen from tears.  An opthalmologist treats your eyes – sometimes you need a corneal transplant after cataract surgery.  Generally not a long wait for a corneal transplant as that is the one organ the people who die generally consent to give to someone else – it is not a long wait like waiting for a kidney or a liver transplant.  The cornea is the clear transparent rounded part of your eye. 

There is a disease called fuchs syndrome I think that may cause a cornea transplant – it is more common in women than in men .  I also think that it gets progressively bad for your site and then may stop getting bad at about age 50. 


Bone graft autograft is from your own bones probably from your hip never from your spine or knee.   Allograft is bone transplant from another donor – this is probably from someone who died – generally a young person – someone without disease – the donor is thoroughly checked so that he or she is healthy and has a history of good health – do not want to transplant diseased bones.  Sometimes transplants are done on your spine.  Sometimes athletes need bone grafts.  You can have pain after a graft – this can occur if a nerve is damaged at the site of the graft.  Bone graft is transferring bone tissue from one person to another. There can also be infection after a bone graft.  Many times the graft can come from a young person who dies in an accident.   Sometimes grafts are done on your knees. The allograft type of bone graft is the most common.  I am thinking that the allograft bone graft is stored in a lab – maybe even frozen. Bone graft repairs or replaces damaged bone tissues. 

Blood donation – two types – large needle to prevent damage to blood cells is put into your vein to draw blood.  Careful care is taken to be sure that the site where they put the needle in is very very clean – you can donate a pint of blood at a time generally.  The fluid regenerates in your body after 24 hours.  The blood cells regenerate in several weeks.   Millions and millions of people need blood transfusions so millions and millions of blood donations are necessary -  blood is stored in a very very flexible bag – this was mentioned in most if not all of the articles that I read.  Many people need transfusions as a result of surgery. 

Aphresis is another type of blood donation.  There you are put on a machine and your blood goes thru it – it is separated  into platelets, red blood cells and soemthign else.  This way they can take what they need.  Your blood circulates thru the machine and then is returned to you.  Once again it is stored in a very flexible bag.  Once again they have to be sure that where the needle is inserted the skin is very very clean. 

You do have to wait to donate blood or do aphresis – you cannot do either the very next day or the very next week.

The bone damage that is to re paired is usually in the long bones or spine. There are several materials used for the grafting: allografting which is bone taken from another person in most cases carefully screened bone from a cadaver; autografting which uses the hosts on bone usually from a site close to the site to be grafted. There are artificial substances that can be used for grafting including ceramics, and other mixed materials. These substances do not promote further bone growth as they do not contain autoclasts. Nicotine use, chemotherapy, and radiation slow the healing of the graft.

218,436,1018,1,k2,"The cornea has three different layers and no blood vessels. It absorbs oxygen from tears.
Bone grafts can cause chronic pain if nerves are damaged. A cut will be made near where the insertion will be. Bone graft donors are screen throughout their life to ensure they are healthy, and once they die they become a donor. Also, the sick individual can be his own donor. You might need a graft to either strengthen a bone or because you fractured or broke one, among other reasons. 
Blood has types A, B, AB, and O. O is a universal type and can be used in emergencies, while AB acceptors can accept any type of blood. The differences in the blood types are the antibodies on each red blood cell.  There are special processes that can remove harmful things from the blood with many weeks of blood filtering. Heart and lung or blood disorders can cause problems to the donors, and  should seek medical approval before donating. If coming off surgery, one should wait until they are fully healed and back to full activity levels. You can replenish all the lost blood within 24 hours, and it can take about a week to restore all the lost red blood cells.

219,437,2016,1,k2,"Bone grafts are surgical procedures to replace or strengthen damaged, diseased or missing bone tissue.  A graft is actual bone. A bone graft can alleviate pain and restore function to a body part.  Most are to knees, hips and the spine, or to replace missing bone due to injury or tumors.  After surgery, new bone tissue grows and surrounds the graft.
 An allograft is bone tissue from another person, usually donated from the body of young, healthy  deceased persons.  The tissue is processed to insure that it is free of infection or disease. These are the most common bone grafts. 
An autograft is a graft of bone tissue from the patients own body, usually from the hip.  As autograft tissue is considered  to be from non-essential bones, it is never harvested from knees or the spine.  Although thought to be less likely to cause infection or problems post-surgically than allografts, these are now done less frequently due to the development of synthetic materials that can be used.
The main adverse effects of bone graft surgery are infection or pain due to damage to tendons, cartilage or nerves during the procedure.

Blood donation is done in order to obtain blood or its components for transfusion.  Transfusion may be of whole blood, platelets or red blood cells.  Donation is achieved by accessing a vein in the donor with a large-bore needle to prevent bruising or damaging components.  A donor may give a pint of whole blood at a single sitting, and the volume is replaced in about 24 hours.  A process which separates components of the blood and keeps only certain of them is done by a machine. The red blood cells lost during donation take several weeks to be replaced in the donor.
A blood bank collects and stores blood and its components for later use.  Blood donors are screened for HIV and Hepatitis C, reducing the risk of contracting either from a blood transfusion to less than that of being struck by lightning.  The collected blood is treated by the addition of an anticoagulant and refrigerated for storage for days to years, depending on what component it is.  Blood is also screened for CJD, the human form of mad cow disease.
There are four blood types: A, B, AB and O.  These are characterized by different types of proteins which may be incompatible.  O, the most common type in the US, is considered the universal donor type and may be given to anyone. B is the most frequently found in northern India and South Africa.  AB is considered the univeral recipient.  In addition, blood may be Rh- or Rh+.  A Rh+ recipient can safely receive either type without reaction.

Corneal transplants are the most easily obtained organ transplants as many people indicate their willingness to donate corneas after death than other organs.  The cornea is vital for visual focusing, and transplants are done to improve vision, relieve pain and improve appearance of damaged corneas.  Composed of many layers, the cornea forms a thin dome-shaped covering over the eye.  The principal parts are the outer epithelial layer, the inner endothelial layer and the stroma which lies between.  The cornea contains no blood vessels, and absorbs oxygen from tears.
A transplant may be of all or some of the layers in order to effect repair.  The surgery is called keratoplasty.

The arm vein is used (well-cleaned before needle inserted).

Corneal transplants:  keratoplacy;  three layers to eye; endothelium is deepest layer; stroma is middle layer; epithelium is outer part.  The stroma is the thickest; it is made up of primarily water (76%) and collagen (16%).  The article did not mention what the remaining 8% was.  Collagen is what keeps the eye “elastic.”  The outer layer tends to be self-healing.  There are no blood vessels in any of the three layers.  The top layer can be replaced fairly easily.  The innermost layer requires an hospital and surgery.  The innermost layer pumps liquid into the stroma.  When things are good, there is a perfect balance.  There is a general leakage from the inner layer to the stroma.  If too much liquid moves to the stroma, there is a stretching of the latter.  The outer layer protects the eye from “debris” from the world (dust, for example).  It and the stroma also help the eye focus.  Penetrating and mellor (not spelled correctly) keratoplascy are the two types of surgery.    In many cases, the transplant comes from deceased bodies.
