- under the branch Felidae, 38 species
- found on all continents except Australia and Antarctica
- meat eaters with sharp teeth and claws
- fur helps to regulate temperature- undercoat + overcoat (also known as guard hair)
- have acute senses, reflexes, and agile bodies
- love to run, climb, jump, swim
- skin is loose to help thwart being captured by predators
- communicate with others through smell, sounds, scratching- rubbing up against surfaces leaves a special scent behind denoting territory
- big cats are mostly loners, because there is not enough prey to go around in a big pack- lions are the exception to the rule and live in prides.
