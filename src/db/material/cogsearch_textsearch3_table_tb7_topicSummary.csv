1,4,A33QI63NVR8CUO,1,k1,"I have found that medical science has evolved a lot over the years. Many doctors have made excellent progress in helping people restore their site with cornea transplants and other medical problems. Many eye conditions can cause problems with vision and may even cause your cornea to become damaged. Like synthetic corneas, it can help with restoring site to some individuals. "
2,14,A361EVMLK9O0G1,1,k1,"Blood donations are important because many people rely on them. The plasma in your blood takes time to regenerate after giving a donation, up to a week to replace all the blood cells you lost. Bone grafts are used to repair or replace damaged bones, ligaments, etc. When the bone graft is taken from somewhere in the patients body is is called an autograft. Corneal transplants are regarding eyes surgery and replacements."
3,18,A14WLAP6TCEKO0,1,k1,"Donation of blood and other bodily components is a risky but sometimes necessary procedure. Blood transfusion can be given whole or in parts. For instance, the plasma can be filtered out of donated blood to get at the antibodies the blood possess. Bone can also be donation, thought this often comes from people already deceased. Even a part of the eye, the cornea, can be donated."
4,24,A9L9G563HS81X,1,k1,"I learned something about blood and blood donation.  I do not know very much about anatomy or medicine or health so this topic was slightly tough for me to read and understand.  It gave me some information about how transfusion can help patients who need the blood, and why they need the certain type of blood that they do in order to stay healthy."
5,23,A90JBLDKW71DX,1,k1,Corneal transplants are performed when one needs a new part of their eye that entails a cornea. The entire procedure is called a keratoplasty. The cornea is only nourished by absorbing oxygen because there are not any blood vessels in that part of the eye. People do not need to wait long for a cornea for transplant like other organs.
6,25,A2RYN1S6OSO9KX,1,k1,A bone graft is the transplant of bone tissue. Surgeons use it to rebuild diseased bones and tendons. Every years millions of people need products from blood transfusions because of a disease. People donate blood to be made into products to donate blood. There are different types of blood donations that vary in how the blood is obtained. Taking blood from a vein as whole blood in the most common way.
7,26,A2O5OJXCUFQ3FV,1,k1,Well i learned that bone grafts are bone transplants to help bones regrow and stabilize. There is also another form of graphing called autographing that uses non human bone but man made bone to replace the old bone. These procedures can leave some side effects such as discomfot or severe pain around the surgery spot. This is not most cases though.
8,28,A19C4VNUIIRCPD,1,k1,"There are several different types of donation and medical transplants. Cornea transplants are becoming easier to come by due to most of the donors being deceased. Blood transfusions are easy to come by as well, and large needles are used so as to avoid shearing of red blood cells. Finally, bone transplants are becoming more doable than ever. "
9,30,A2E0FOTFTVWZ7T,1,k1,"The cornea has three layers: epithelium, stroma, and endothelium. If someone has a cornea transplant not all layer may need to be replaced. Corneas are more likely to be donated! Smoking can cause nonunion of bones. Blood can be donated as a whole or can be separated. The four components of blood are the red and white blood cells, plasma and platelets. "
10,31,A1I7XL4VK40KOD,1,k1,"There are different types of medical transplants: Cornea transplants through the loss of a bad cornea, or loss of vision.  The blood donation takes a couple of ways to take blood from the body, one through a plastic bag and a little needle through an artery and the other through a machine (I can not remember the name) in which it separates the blood cells red and white from the blood donation.  The four types of blood are A, B, AB and O.  O is the universal donor, and AB is the universal opposite in that it can take all types of blood donations."
11,37,A3NGG3QTB0WINC,1,k1,"There are three major types of donations, blood, bone and cornea. Bone can involve either the bone itself or marrow, and can come from the individual, or another donor. Blood comes from a donor, and can be whole blood, or have just needed parts of it extracted. Cornea almost always come from deceased donors, and can be whole or layers. "
12,38,A1N54C8VTUX1CF,1,k1,"Blood can be separated using a special machine to make blood products from whole blood. Blood is taken from a vein. The four components of blood are: red blood cells, white blood cells, plasma and platelets. A healthy person can donate 1 pint of blood per visit. Platelets are used to control bleeding by improving clotting. Plasma fluid is comprised of 92% water. Plasma can be donated once per month."
13,39,http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~cchin6/textsearch1/,1,k1,"The main topic that I learned about was blood donation. I read articles discussing blood donations, and that there are different types of donation. Healthy adults can donate a pint of blood regularly, and everything that is taken is replaced within a week or two. Blood donation is a necessary service because millions of people need blood for medical reasons. What they need from the blood depends greatly on what is wrong with them. "
14,41,AKM7BAAH9OPGW,1,k1,"I learned about what kinds of procedures can be done, and what organs are needed. I learned a little about the process by which these organs are taken, and under what kinds of circumstances. I learned about the donation process and the bureaucracy behind it. I also learned about some of the benefits that are experienced by this system. It also included information about donor rights. "
15,48,A3VMCKYN22X0CO,1,k1,"Blood donation limits you to donate 1 pint. Whole blood will normally be replaced in your system in as little as 24 hours. A large needle is required to lessen damage to the red blood cells. Apheresis is also used to separate the bloods plasma, platelets and red blood cells. Corneal transplants procedures are known as keratplasty and helps you regain your focusing power"
16,51,A2FSO42T7M8MFY,1,k1,I LEARNED THAT YOU CAN GET A SUDDEN FEVER DURING OR WITHIN A DAY OF A BLOOD TRANSFUSION.  IT IS THE BODIES NORMAL RESPONSE TO THE WHITE BLOOD CELLS IN THE DONATED BLOOD.  AND THAT SOME BLOOD BANKS REMOVE THE WHITE BLOOD CELLS FROM THE WHOLE BLOOD.  IT MAKES IT LESS LIKELY THAT THE REACTION WILL HAPPEN IN DOING THIS.
17,54,A3GR2PCJPT0S6U,1,k1,i did not realize that bone transplants were so tedious. and that there were different types. I also did not know you could use different bones from various other types of bones to fix bones that are not the same bone that was damaged. In other words you can take bone from an arm and use it in a leg
18,53,A1QOCQW43OSMD3,1,k1,"Blood replaced 24 hours after donation. Healthy adults can donate a pint. Red blood has hemoglobin, a protien that carries oxygen to cells. Plasma is 55% of blood. Blood can be seperated into different parts and regular blood can be stored for 1 month.  Bone grafts can be taken from marrow or bone. Only living bone called ostoblasts can be transplanted. Corneal transplant can help pain and restore vision. People can donate part or all of cornea after death so it is more common than liver or kidney transplants. "
19,55,A26RO8GGTQAXGG,1,k1,"Bone grafts are helped to stabalize fractures or fix wear and tear. Bone can come from self or a donor. Small or large areas can be strengthened or repaired. Corneal transplants can be one 2 or 3 layers, and new methods are being developed all the time. More corneas are donated than other organ types like kidneys or liver so wait times are shorter."
20,65,A128BUMKWWS54Z,1,k1,"
I read articles from all three of the topics found under ""Donation and Medical Transplants"". I learned about bone transplants, and the two different types of bone grafts that occur. I also read about corneal transplants and the different methods and types of transplants that occur. Finally I read about blood donations and the various methods and types of donations that make up that area."
21,68,A2QVJHKCKODQO6,1,k1,I learned a lot about blood donations.  Blood has four components.There are different ways of taking the collecting the blood from a donor depending on if whole blood or one or more component is needed. Apheresis is the technique that is used to get one component at a time.  This process takes a varying amount of time depending on what is being collected.  
22,67,A2H74STYH3PLT1,1,k1,"there are three blood types,a,b, and o. those with ab can receive any donated blood and those with o can be given to anyone. blood banks screen the blood, separate it into components and freeze it for later use. bone grafting is using donated bone from a deceased person or donor or using bone from another part of your own body. grafting bone strengthens existing bone tissue to help with chronic pain and new health bone growth. corneal transplants may be done with the entire cornea being replaces or one of the three layers of the cornea. the cornea is donated from deceased peoples"
23,71,A8MBISMEGYCA4,1,k1,"The blood is usually stored in a flexible plastic bag The body replaces the lost fluids within 24 hoursMillions of people need blood transfusions or blood products each year because of surgery or disease.The process for whole blood donation usually takes about one hour with the collection itself usually lasting only about 10 minutes.A cornea transplant is a surgical procedure to replace part of your cornea with tissue from a donor. The procedure is also called a keratoplasty. The cornea is the transparent, dome-shaped surface of your eye.10 percent of people with keratoconus also have a family member with the condition.A bone graft is the transplant of bone tissue.Tissue banks carefully screen the medical histories of the donors and freeze the donated bones.The potential drawbacks of the surgical procedure include chronic pain from the surgical site"
24,73,A27JZQQ5Y1I8RL,1,k1,"A person can donate blood if they are over 110 pounds. Blood can be washed down to retrieve different components from the blood. red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. They use a larger needle to keep the vein open for the flow of blood. After someone has donated it takes twenty four hours to recoup it in the body. transplants from bone are very successful. Either from man made or retrieved from someones body.  "
25,74,A18WPTVQPM9LBH,1,k1,"Bone grafts are used to fix injuries and to replace lost bone due to cancer.  Allografts are from donors and autografts are self donated.  There can be continuing pain as a result of bone grafts.  Cornea transplants are becoming more common as more people identify themselves as donors.  There are three layers to the cornea and there is not blood running through the cornea.  The cornea is nourished by the air.  Blood donations are important for injuries and surgeries.  There are different types of blood as well as RH factors that must be known so the patient gets the right type of blood.  Receiving the wrong blood type has many consequences , up to and including death."
26,80,A36DDHDQ56N60C,1,k1,"I learned that the types of organs and tissues that can be transplanted are bone, blood and corneas (certainly among others). All types of transplants carry certain risks, among the risks are rejection of the donated tissue and introduction of foreign diseases into the body. Transplants can also be made from synthetic material if donor tissues are not so available. "
27,81,A66GVEZ7BBLH,1,k1,"human blood has several types: A, B, AB or O. The blood transfusion has to match the blood type. The donator for blood has a limitation. Pregnant woman, people under 16 or 17 years old, people lighter than 110 pounds may not be able to donate blood. The blood bank need to test the blood for HIV or hepatitis viruses. Some ingredients may be removed before transfusion.  "
28,82,A1LR1VZBKTV4Y1,1,k1,"There are 3 layers to the cornea. Blood transfusion is done with a large scale needle so that the cells arent damaged. Bone grafts have 2 different names, whether they come from the person who needs it, or from another donor. There are different surgeries on the eye, depending on which layer of the cornea needs the work, and an air bubble is used to push cells to the innermost layer of the cornea."
29,87,A167SYXGXFU7C8,1,k1,"I learned about bone grafts, corneal transplants and blood donation. Bone and corneal material is largely from cadavers. But bone can also be autolugos(sp?). Blood donations can be given to patients in the form of whole blood, or cells(rbc,wbc,platelets) or just plasma. Corneal transplant can take a long time to heal and sutures are used and so is a bubble. "
30,88,A3GWGTLQNHVQ2M,1,k1,"I learned quite a bit about donation and medical transplants.  First, there is blood transfusions- which are donated.  Then there are cornea transplants.  This is technically dontated- however it is from deceased people. So it is from an organ donor.  Then there is skin grafts. Some are donated from deceased people. You also can take your own healthy skin and donate it to yourself from other areas of your body. "
31,78,A14HW0XMI4R2ON,1,k1," A corneal transplant is a somewhat common procedure where the thin,dome shaped part of the eye,the cornea, is either partially or completely removed and then replaced with a healthy donor cornea. Bone grafts are used to repair and rebuild diseased bone, tendon and cartilidge in the knees hips and spine. The bone material can come either from the patient, a donor or a sythestic material. Blood transfusion starts at a blood bank where whole blood is collected from donors to be used in transfusions and blood products such as plasma."
32,91,A1VJAEPNA6YARO,1,k1,"  Blood donation is something that people volunteer for to help people who need blood.  The most common way is to take it from the vein as whole blood.  The blood is then stored in blood banks, where it will have heparin put into it to keep it good for a long time.  People have different types of blood, and people with type O can donate to anyone."
33,92,A77K8W55MJEKX,1,k1,Blood donation is a way in which a person agrees to give his or her drawn to another person in need of blood. Many people need blood transfusions due to medical conditions. Healthy people who are older than 18 can donate up to a pint of blood without risking their health. Human body can replace the lost fluids within 24 hours to recover after blood donation. The RBCs may take up to several weeks to regain count again. 
34,94,A98XHW6B1VSSQ,1,k1,"I mostly read about blood donation and blood transplants. there are 4 different blood types. A, B, AB and O. Different parts of the world have larger amounts of different blood types. People who donate blood have requirements based on age and weight. You have to be at least 110 pounds there are maximum weight requirement except in regard to the chair being able to hold the weight of the person donating.  "
35,93,A1O67YS3DU0ZHX,1,k1,"There are various ways doctors and surgeons have to help those who are in need of donations and transplants. One of the most common ways is through a blood donation. Most healthy people can donate blood with no problem, and their fluids will be replaced within 24 hours, with the red blood cells being replaced after a few weeks. Bone grafts can be performed to help a variety of conditions, from repairing and rebuilding disease, to alleviating pain. Transplants can either come from the patient themselves, or from another donor. Another procedure is corneal transplants, with most corneas coming from decased donors. "

37,99,A224B7BAQ0MZSN,1,k1,"Cornea transplants are surgeries to replace the domed, transparent part of the eye.  It can include one or all three layers.  Blood donation is carefully screened for health.  Blood has different types, uses, and donation procedures.  Bone transplants are grafts to replace or strengthen broken and diseased bone.  There are different kinds and there is a risk of pain afterwards."
38,102,A2C39KTRMOM1XZ,1,k1,a bone graft transplants bone tissue to repair damage rom an accident or disease if it is from a donor it is called an alliograft it comes from a desceased donor. if it comes from the patient themselves it is called an autograft could be side effects of bain from incision site or rejection of donor tissue.
39,106,ATADQXPHL10Y8,1,k1,"Reading the articles pertaining to donation and medical transplants, it can be deduced that through various medical procedures, the way of life for many human beings can be vastly improved. Whether using skin grafting or corneal intrusions, science has developed ways of using our own body to regenerate and restore or alleviate chronic pain in individuals who may never have known there was a way out."
40,109,A1AVB030QDFWCE,1,k1,"There are three types of donation and medical transplants that I read about. The first was blood transfusions, the second was bone grafts, and the third was cornea transplants. Blood donation and transfusions are common and the blood goes through a rigorous testing process to make sure that it is safe. Bone grafts help heal diseased bones. Cornea transplants help restore vision."
41,114,A2698HJZM7SE4C,1,k1,"The first topic was Blood Donations.  The article talked about how blood is donated.  I learned they filter the blood and take what they need from it in most cases (plasma, red blood cells etc.)  I also learned that each adult human can donate 1 pint of blood.  The second topic was Bone Grafts.  I learned that you can get bone tissue from another bone in your own body or from another person.  I also learned there are some complications like the body rejecting the tissue.  The third topic was corneal transplants.  I learned that corneas are fairly easy to procure so you can get a transplant fairly easy."
42,121,A3BHRFFG75X3GO,1,k1,"People need cornea transplants if they have damaged vision or pain. The cornea transplant is called keratoplasty. The cornea has three layer, the endothelium, stroma, and epithelium. Cornea transplants happen more than kidney and liver transplants because the cornea can be transplanted from a dead person. Corneas have no blood vessels. It gets oxygen from tears.

There are two kinds of bone grafts. Autograft is from the the same person. Allograft is a transplant from one person to another. People who have some bone removed from a tumor get a bone graft. Or athletes who have been injured. The bone graft site can be painful.

Blood transfusion is done with a needle and the blood is stored in a plastic bag. After you give blood, your body will make new blood cells within a few weeks. The blood at the facility is kept from clotting."
43,125,A2WYXS94418JXA,1,k1,Bone grafts are transplants of bone tissue.  They are used to repair damaged or diseased cartilage and tissue in certain parts of the body. Allografts are  transplants of bone that come from a dead person.  Blood donations are used for transfusions and blood products.  Sometimes the blood is filtered for specific blood products.  Cornea transplants (keratoplasty) use donor tissue.
44,129,AX0KHOWMMM6Z2,1,k1,"I thought all topics available related to this.  For blood, it can be donated whole or in part by way of a process called apheresis that separates out the part needed for donation (platelet, red blood cells, etc.) and returns the rest.  People who donate regenerate the fluids and red blood sells from 24 hours to a few weeks.  A small needle can damage the red blood cells, so typically large ones take blood. Cornea transplants replace all or part of a cornea.  There are three layers.  There is a good supply of corneas available.  Bone grafts can be taken to repair injury or disease (or help those with cancer).  Clean and disease free bones can be taken from cadavers."

The cornea comes from die people. "
46,136,A32ZPYIWFEUCDX,1,k1,"Donation and Medical Transplants can be: Corneal, Blood, and Bone.
Bone donations are usually from deceased donors. The bones are frozen so the vital tissue can be stored longer. Bone donation can also be from the bone marrow. 

Corneal transplants can be from one to all three of the corneal layer. The most usual is just one layer. The Cornea does not have any blood vessels so it gets its oxygen from tears. Corneal transplants can restore sight to blind individuals and also reduce pain.

Blood donations can be of whole blood, Red cells, plasma, and platelets. Plasma can be frozen and can last for up to a year. It is used for burn victims and those with liver disease and clotting factor problems.

48,140,A3S5QDW6OU35NH,1,k1,"I learned about three different types of donated and medically used transplants, corneal, blood and bone. 

Corneal transplants are required after damage is done to the cornea of the eye, reducing or stopping the ability to focus. Because more people are willing to be donors of corneal tissue it is a fairly common procedure with a waiting list much shorter then for other tissue donations such as lungs or liver. 

Blood transfusions use a larger needle to prevent damaging the red blood cells.

There are two types of bone graft depending on source of bone. 
50,144,A179EXKWCPDVJY,1,k1,"I learned that cornea transplants are needed to help repair damaged eyes. The waiting list for these transplants, unlike liver and kidney transplants, is not as long for the patient since more people are willing to donate their corneas for transplants.

Most of the fluids donated in this manner are replenished within twenty four hours of the donation."
53,148,A14NP6X071S7GK,1,k1,I learned that people actually get bone transplants. Basically they cut out the nasty bone and then stick bone in from a dead person or from part of your body where you wont have any weird defect then they pump these cells inside you that help make it bond so it doesnt get rejected. I also learned that your eye has a lot of layers and they use a cookie cutter tool to cut a piece out and put a new piece in.
54,152,A14OUWUVFGIIUM,1,k1,"Bone grafts are transplants of tissues. Surgeons use grafts to repair/rebuild diseased bones tendons and cartilage. Allografts come from deceased and autografts come from within the patient. Allografts are used over 900,000 times a year, are used because they reduce the number of surgical sites.

Bone grafts are used by surgeons for transplanting of bone tissue to patients that have had certain cancers or bone diseases as well as accidents and trauma to the skeletal system. There are two kinds of grats allografts which come from donors or other people and autograft which is bone transplanted from the same person onto the affecte area for treatment. 

Cornea transplants involve the rounded part of the eye that consists of endothelium and epithelium. People who need or get these procedures done usually have vision issues or glare and cannot focus or see too well. With these transplants, the patient will be able to focus and see much better."

70,203,A17I88FWG7XU6A,1,k1,a bone graft is a transplant of bone tissue. There is also an allograft transplant where bone or tissue is transplanted from one person to another. There is also a cornea transplant where a part of your cornea is replaced from a donor. Blood donation happens when a person gives blood for transfusions or used for other blood situations. Millions of people need blood transfusions. 
71,192,A14CX1IUDSVFLL,1,k1,"Bone Grafting is transplanting of bone tissue surgeons use this grafting process to repair and rebuild diseased bones.Once body receive grafting of bone it provides framework for growth of fresh and living bone.Blood donation person agrees to have blood drawn so that it can used for transfusion and to make component of blood products. The body replaces the lost fluid within 24 hours of a blood donation,however lost blood cells get replenished in several weeks.
Cornea transplants is a surgical procedure also called keratoplasty.  "
72,205,A319HGTKM0UY0V_2,1,k1,"People donate blood which can be used as is or seperated into ""blood products."" These are the plasma, platelettes or leukocytes. Bone graft are used, generally, to replace bone, cartilage and ligaments in the hips, spine, or knees. Corneal implants can be used to repair vision, reduce pain or improve the look of a damage cornea. There are 3 parts of the cornea. They are the epithelium, endothelium and th stroma."
73,206,A23S3TBFRILU5H,1,k1,"There are many different types of donations/medical transplants. This article involved corneal transplants, bone grafts, and blood. Within each area, careful screening is needed prior to any transplant or blood transfusion. Each area has its own criteria. Millions of people need these medical services for various reasons such as accidents, illnesses, injuries, and/or emergencies. With the exceptions of blood donations, many transplants come from the deceased."
74,207,A30QRYULPVYZQV_2,1,k1,"First I looked at blood transfusions.  I learned that either whole blood or blood componants can be donated.  If componets are given, a special machine seperates the blood and removes a specific compnant and returns the remaining blood back to the donor.  If whole blood is given, a healthy adult can give a pint at a time.  It takes about 24 hours for the body to replace the fluids and up to several weeks to replace the red blood cells that are removed.  

Then I looked at bone transplants.  This is called a bone graft.  The donated tissue is used to repair and rebuild damaged bone tissue from either broken bones or illness.  The person receiving the graft is given the framework for the body to rebuild the bones.

Millions of people yearly need blood and bone tissue donations."
75,209,A2EMG4S9LWOIZZ,1,k1,"Organ donation takes healthy organs and tissues from one person for transplantation into another. Most organ and tissue donations occur after the donor has died. But some organs and tissues can be donated while the donor is alive.Despite advances in medicine and technology, and increased awareness of organ donation and transplantation, the gap between supply and demand continues to widen.  "
76,210,A1YBX7P5PY8LL,1,k1,"It is important that people learn about these medical procedures, the effects, and the importance for them to help people in difficult situations.  Tissue, bone, and blood donation can replace injured or diseased that may not be able to be used.  Today, medical technology is so advanced that a person with a debilitating disease or condition can eventually live  a normal life. "
