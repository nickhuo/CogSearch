2,4,A33QI63NVR8CUO,2,prac_k1,I had learned that cats are excellent hunters and their bodies are made for hunting and for their environment. Cats are also excellent meat eaters.There fur is meant to camouflage in the grass so they can hunt for their prey. There paws are also made specially for hunting as well. They have sharp claws and fur that covers them so they can keep quiet.
