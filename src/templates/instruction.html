            <b>Now, here is the formal task.</b>
        </p>
    
        <p style='line-height:130%'>
            Your task is to learn about some topics related health. There are five main topics, and your goal is to learn as much as you can about them. You will have 15 minutes to learn about these health topics before I ask you to answer some questions. <b>It is very important for you to pay attention to the articles and do your best to learn about the topics.</b> You will receive bonus money based on your performance.
        </p>
    
        <p style='line-height:130%'>
            During the learning phase, you will select one topic at a time and read a collection of articles about it. You can read each article at your own pace. After you read each article, you have a choice. You can either continue reading about this topic by pressing the “Read Next article” button OR you can switch to a new topic. You only have 15 minutes to learn about health, so do your best to <b>concentrate and stay with a topic only as long as you feel you are still learning something</b>. If the articles in the topic are ,<b>either too hard or not helping you to learn anything new, you might want to decide to switch to a new topic</b>. This is your choice.
        </p>
    
        <p style='line-height:130%'>
            Note that there are more articles than you can completely read within 15 minutes so you should make your decisions about <b>whether to continue or stop reading carefully</b> so that you can learn as much information as possible about Donation and Medical Transplant.
        </p>
    
        <p style='line-height:130%'>
            After reading each article within a topic, you will be asked to rate how easy the text was, how much new information you thought was in the article, AND how much you learned. You will be asked to make these ratings on a scale from 0 to 100 by moving the circle:
